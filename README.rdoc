The general goal of this project is to build a todo list application. Here is the spec, as well as some rules:

No CSS. No JavaScript. No JSON. (Yet.) The application should support multiple users, each with their own private todo list. Use RESTful resource routing wherever appropriate. Use sensible URL design (e.g. when I'm logged in, my dashboard should be “/dashboard” – not “/users/5”). Do not hard-code any application paths. Use named routes and the methods for accessing those named routes. Show the currently logged-in user's email address (or some other identifying information) in the header. Use the layout view to keep things DRY. When you finish a basic todo application in accordance with the above guidelines, submit for approval using the usual protocol (GitHub Issue, link to deployed site, mention me in a help channel).

After receiving approval, implement some/all of the following:

(No particular order…)

Research CSS frameworks, like Twitter Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation, or others. Can you implement a framework onto your website for a quick-and-easy design? There will be multiple installation instructions. Avoid the ones that use SASS, LESS, Bower, or Grunt. You should use “vanilla” CSS/JS. You will want to disable turbolinks first. Implementation task categorization. Implement task ordering. Implement marking tasks completed using AJAX. You will want to disable turbolinks first.
